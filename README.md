Seoul's (Seoul, South Korea) Land Prices Prediction

There are many features that determine land price.

In particular, since 'home prices' is very sensitive issue in Korean society,
The interest in features that determine land price is always hot.

For example, recently, Gangseo-gu (in Seoul, South Korea) has been in conflict with parents of students with disabilities, 
arguing that residents opposing the construction of special schools lower land prices and housing prices.

Therefore, the distribution of major facilities and infrastructure 
(such as special schools, large hospitals, bar or pub, lodging houses, and large supermarkets) 
are selected as potential variables that can affect land prices.

We tested whether those variables are actually related to land prices.

In addition, we tried to predict land prices using various machine learning algorithms 
and make a prediction model with small errors.
